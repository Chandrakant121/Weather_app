# Weather App:-
Hello,
Solo Project Build to get weather data as per users location or User can also search for their respective city.

# Technology I Used:
1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. JavaScript
4. Google Map API
5. Weather API.

In this app I used weather api to get weather data and for map I used Google map api. User can search weather of any city by searching name of city in search bar.
He can get a data of of week with map and current temperature, humidity and pressure.
